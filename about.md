[America's Test Kitchen](http://www.americastestkitchen.com) is a real 2,500 square foot test kitchen located just
outside of Boston that is home to more than three dozen full-time cooks and
product testers. Our mission is simple: to develop the absolute best recipes for
all of your favorite foods. To do this, we test each recipe 30, 40, sometimes as
many as 70 times, until we arrive at the combination of ingredients, technique,
temperature, cooking time, and equipment that yields the best, most-foolproof
recipe.

Our [recipes](http://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes), [equipment reviews](http://www.americastestkitchen.com/equipment_reviews), [ingredient taste tests results](http://www.americastestkitchen.com/taste_tests), and kitchen tips
are made available through our magazines, our websites, our television series;
_America's Test Kitchen_ and [_Cook's Country_](http://www.cookscountry.com) from _America's Test Kitchen_, and our cookbooks.
