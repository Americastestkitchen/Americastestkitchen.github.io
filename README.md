# ATK Developer Blog

This is the America's Test Kitchen Developer Blog. We'll post about things we're doing in tech here. From OSS to silly hardware hacks for our office.

## Setting up Locally

```sh
gem install jekyll
gem install jekyll-gist
rbenv rehash  # If you're using rbenv (you should be)
git clone https://github.com/Americastestkitchen/Americastestkitchen.github.io
```

## Writing a Post

```sh
git checkout -b post-about-nothing
touch _posts/2014-04-12-post-about-nothing.markdown
```

Edit the post, don't forget the front matter. Keep in mind the categories go into the URL of the post, so keep them consistent and short.
