## A CSS spirit quest

Our development team recently held an internal 'mini-conference', during which
most of the developers got a chance to present on a topic of interest. The idea
was to talk about something relevant to our professional development, but also
something that we are really passionate about.

Probably as much to my surprise as everyone else's, I've recently become very
passionate about writing good quality CSS, and decided to give a talk on the
subject. I've been writing a lot of CSS over the past few months, as part of
some really cool front-end redesign projects our team has been working on. I
found that the more I cared about following CSS best practices, and the
stricter I tried to be with myself in following them, the easier (and more fun)
the process became. I think all developers could benefit from treating CSS as a
legitimate discipline worthy of serious study, and in doing so would probably
find their disdain for it subsiding.

practices here:
