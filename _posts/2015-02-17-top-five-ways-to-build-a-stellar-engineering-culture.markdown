Cultivating a good engineering culture, regardless of business vertical,
is a daunting task for any individual and team. Even when a good culture is 
achieved, it still requires maintenance and attention because all cultures are
constantly evolving.

It is important to note that _great cultures don't stop here_. Great cultures do
employ many other things that make them great (CI, Peer Review, Pair Programming
, TDD to some degree, etc.) and are constantly looking to improve in all areas.

## Small Snippet About Us and Our Team
America's Test Kitchen is a company of around 150 people. Of that, there are 6
full-time engineers and 2 co-op engineers. I believe that our small size is what
makes us such ardent defenders of our culture that we are continually building
and maintaining.

The challenges and problems that face us from a culture standpoint might be 
different than organizations that have a higher engineer to other ratio.
Either way, any great technical culture is built upon the same foundational
elements outlined below.

On to the list!!

## Iterative
All great cultures are constantly changing to fit the needs and demands of their
team. Being able to continually modify your processes and workflows to best fit
the team is crucial to building a stellar culture.

Recently we uncovered an issue with our development process where 
outstanding Pull Requests (PR) were not getting peer reviewed. All of our
PR metadata was getting dumped into a Pull Request channel in hipchat and was
basically generating a lot of noise. After 15 minutes of discussion, the 
team agreed that it was best to fix this problem by altering our processes and
injecting a Code Review mandate prior to our code entering QA. So far, this 
has solved the issue we identified and we have been more productive because of
this minor iteration.

## Honest
All great cultures are able to be open, honest, and transparent with regard to
contributions, processes, and more. Having honesty as a cornerstone for your
culture will help everyone be more productive, more collaborative, and better 
teammates.

Every other week, we get together as a team during our [retrospective](http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/sprint-retrospective) and
determine as a whole what part of our process didn't work and what, if anything,
someone was particularly bothered with during the prior 2 weeks. During one of
the meetings, it became readily apparent that I was becoming incommunicative
during the most important times of our sprint. Instead of taking offense to
being called out, I took it as an opportunity to help grow and be better about
my communication with team members because of the culture we have. My team 
members are telling me of my shortcomings because they want me to be better, and
that is where a culture of honesty is crucially important.

## Collaborative
All great cultures have various techniques of collaboration in order to best
solve the problem at hand. 

One team member was staring at a CSS box model problem for quite
some time and was unable to determine exactly what the root cause of the issue
was. Within 5 minutes of a pair programming session, the solution was found. A
fresh perspective on the problem was all that was needed in order to find
the issue and solve it.

## Challenging
All great cultures are continually challenging its team members. Being able to
challenge each other will:
- Strengthen skillsets that the team can utilize in the future.
- Encourage professional development in areas where people may be uncomfortable.
- Invest in team members because of the above 2 bullet points.

A team member was working on a part of the stack they had little
familiarity with, our ecommerce platform. When a new feature was built, it had 
some bugs in its implementation. Instead of someone senior jumping in to
save the day, we let the author (with SOME guidance) continue to drive the
feature and the process. We knew the fix would be somewhat challenging, but 
gaining that knowledge and the resulting confidence would be a huge boost for
that team member. The bug was fixed rather quickly and the team member is happy
they were able to see the feature start, to finish, to fixing production bugs.

## Team Buy-In
All great cultures require 100% team buy-in in order for it to be fully
effective. Without 100% buy-in, overall team morale and productivity can nose 
dive until corrective actions are taken.

Early on when we were transitioning from waterfall to agile, we had
some late bloomers in understanding why it was important for us to make this
shift. The early days of our agile process looked waterfall-ish because it's 
what we knew "worked". 3-4 full sprints in, those late bloomers realized (in
our retrospectives) that the things slowing them down were because of our 
waterfall processes. A sprint or two later, our entire team saw the productivity
gains from shedding the last remaining waterfall processes that remained.

## Conclusion
Every company and individual is very, _VERY_ different. While the above may not
work for everyone, it has served us well at America's Test Kitchen.

Most importantly, we are happy.
