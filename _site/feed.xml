        <title>Troubleshooting Node Http.request timeout errors in an isomorphic React application</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July of 2016 ATK relaunched the americastestkitchen.com website as an Node/React isomorphic single page application. The project was extremely challenging and the timeline was tight but we were able to deliver a solid product that met the technical requirements set forth by the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the deployment went extremely smoothly with very little in the way of unexpected developments. As developers we enjoyed working with React and Node. We were able to build a ton of functionality in the tight timeline afforded by the business. In September, as our seasonal traffic started picking up, our app began sporadically responding to clients with 500 errors. This is where the story begins…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-problem&quot;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking through the Heroku logs, we saw the following errors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Unexpected error in API { FetchError: request to https://www.americastestkitchen.com/some-api-endpoint failed, reason: connect ETIMEDOUT
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking through some SO posts, we found a post that seemed promising. It had the following comment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;By default, Node has 4 workers to resolve DNS queries. If your DNS query takes long-ish time, requests will block on the DNS phase, and the symptom is exactly ESOCKETTIMEDOUT or ETIMEDOUT.

Try increasing your uv thread pool size:

export UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE=128
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sounded reasonable and local testing indicated that changing this setting didn’t have an adverse effect on app performance. Once deployed to production, however, we quickly realized that this was a false start. The change did not fix the problem. Back to the investigation…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point we were also seeing an H13 error in our Heroku logs. From Heroku’s error documentation “This error is thrown when a process in your web dyno accepts a connection, but then closes the socket without writing anything to it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example H13 error&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;2010-10-06T21:51:37-07:00 heroku[router]: at=error code=H13 desc=&quot;Connection closed without response&quot; method=GET path=&quot;/&quot; host=myapp.herokuapp.com fwd=17.17.17.17 dyno=web.1 connect=3030ms service=9767ms status=503 bytes=0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After trying a quick-fix we realized that while we searched for a fix we had to, at the very least, provide slightly better error page for our users. The 500 errors that they were seeing were being displayed after the max-timeout was surpassed - which was 30 seconds! Additionally, the error page was the standard Heroku error page which does not inspire confidence. So, we set out to implement a custom timeout response and install some extra logging to help us gather some additional data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this, needed to inject some custom middleware in our Express pipeline. To start, we set the timeout at 25s, 5s short of the Heroku timeout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our main express application file for our front-end code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;app.use(timeout('25000'));
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timeout code (TimeOutPage is a React component that renders our error page):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;function onTimeout(delay, cb, req, res) {
  return () =&amp;gt; {
    const {
      cookies: { ... },
      headers: { 'user-agent': user_agent },
      url
    } = req;
    const agent = useragent.parse(user_agent);
    console.error({
      url,
      user_agent: agent.toString()
    });
    const html = ReactDOMServer.renderToString(
      &amp;lt;TimeOutPage /&amp;gt;
    );
    cb(res.status(503).send(html));
  };
}

/**
 * Copied and updated from https://github.com/expressjs/timeout
 * to allow us to render an error template instead of a plain string
 * error and to log data to console.
 */
export default (time, options) =&amp;gt; {
  const opts = options || {};
  const delay = Number(time || 5000);
  const respond = opts.respond === undefined || opts.respond === true;

  return (req, res, next) =&amp;gt; {
    const id = setTimeout(() =&amp;gt; {
      req.timedout = true;
      req.emit('timeout', delay);
    }, delay);
    if (respond) {
      req.on('timeout', onTimeout(delay, next, req, res));
    }
    req.clearTimeout = () =&amp;gt; clearTimeout(id);
    req.timedout = false;
    onFinished(res, () =&amp;gt; clearTimeout(id));
    onHeaders(res, () =&amp;gt; clearTimeout(id));
    next();
  };
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-solution&quot;&gt;The Solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we had installed a bit of a backstop for that ugly 500 error page, we focused on the H13 error. Our Node application connects to our api for data retrieval. On each page request there could be several http connections from Node to the api. The description of the H13 lead us to believe that our application was connecting to the API and then getting all gummed up. Sounds like we need to do a better job of managing these connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking into the Node documentation for the http/https module (where we should have started in the first place - RTFM right?) we find some interesting options for managing our connections. In particular, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_agent&quot;&gt;http.Agent&lt;/a&gt; class was standing out. By default, http requests from Node can, but are not required to, have a custom &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Agent&lt;/code&gt; property on the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;options&lt;/code&gt; argument for an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http.request&lt;/code&gt;. By omitting your own &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Agent&lt;/code&gt; option we were accepting the defaults. The answer was staring us in the face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Agent&lt;/code&gt; documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;const http = require('http');
var keepAliveAgent = new http.Agent({ keepAlive: true });
options.agent = keepAliveAgent;
http.request(options, onResponseCallback);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key here is the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;keepAlive:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. As described by the documentation: &lt;em&gt;“Keep sockets around in a pool to be used by other requests in the future”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deploying this change was the solution to our problem. I was still bothered by the fact that our Node app wouldn’t retry a request if it received an initial failure and that it would try for (by default with Heroku) 30 seconds before the connection was killed. There were certainly times where a connection would go astray on the first try and work perfectly well on the second. We don’t want to wait around for 30 seconds to find out that we should have just tried a second time. To address this concern, we added a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;timeout&lt;/code&gt; option to our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http.request&lt;/code&gt; options and then in our response processing, we looked for timeouts and issued a retry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our node application uses the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;isomorphic-fetch&lt;/code&gt; package, which is an abstraction layer on top of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http.request&lt;/code&gt; module. So, here is an approximation of our code (shortened and simplified):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;let response;
let statusCode;
const fetchOptions = {
  agent: new http.Agent({ keepAlive: true }),
  timeout: 5000,
};

...setup code for our request...

response = await fetch(url, fetchOptions).catch(catchError);
statusCode = response.status;

...other code looking for errors...

// retry once for timeouts
if (statusCode === 503) {
  console.error('RETRY', url);
  response = await fetch(url, fetchOptions).catch(catchError);
  statusCode = response.status;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this new code, we were now able to pool our sockets which fixed the timeout issues and we were able to retry our requests in the case of a temporary blip. In the end we wish that we had addressed these issues prior to launch but the troubleshooting process was a great learning experience. In my years as a software engineer I have learned that no matter diligent you are in your process and review you can’t catch everything. The key is to learn from your mistakes and improve for next time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Building a Recommendation Engine with Collaborative Filtering</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At America’s Test Kitchen, our engineering team
spends two days every quarter participating in Professional Development Days -
a hackathon-esque opportunity for each of us to build something cool and learn new things. My recipe recommender proof-of-concept was
a product of our last professional development cycle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-challenge&quot;&gt;The Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our recipe pages currently list manually curated links to related content
(see the ‘More From Cooks Illustrated’ section at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/8125-chocolate-crinkle-cookies&quot;&gt;bottom of this page&lt;/a&gt;).
This usually includes articles on equipment or ingredients needed to make the
recipe, or suggested accompaniments and variations that were listed with the
recipe in the magazine.&lt;br /&gt;
My goal was to supplement the manually curated related content with a feature
similar to the “Users who bought this item also bought these items” section
on Amazon’s product pages.
In theory, this would keep readers more engaged by giving them
an easy way to browse to new recipes without having to navigate back to a home
page or searching for a new term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-solution&quot;&gt;The Solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started by researching the techniques used by existing recommendation
engines. I found that many of them used a machine learning concept called
collaborative filtering, which involves leveraging user’s likes or dislikes to
measure the similarity of elements in a dataset. The assumption this technique
makes is that items which are ‘liked’ by a similar set of users are similar
themselves. An example of a collaborative filtering is Facebook’s
“People you may know” feature, which generates predictions under the assumption
that people with a similar set of friends are likely to know each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collaborative filtering was the perfect technique to build the recommendation
engine. We already had a huge dataset of User Favorites - a feature that allows
users to save recipes they cooked or plan to cook for later viewing. I realized
I would be able to use this data to compare the sets of users who favorited each pair of recipes and determine their similarity. Each recipe page would recommend the recipes with the greatest similarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-algorithm&quot;&gt;The Algorithm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to implement the collaborative filtering technique, I needed an
algorithm to determine the similarity of sets. I found a statistic called the
Jaccard Coefficient that scores the similarity of two sets by dividing the
cardinality (length) of their intersection set by the cardinality of their union
set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/jaccard.png&quot; alt=&quot;Jaccard Coefficient&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used the Jaccard Coefficient to build a matrix of similarity set scores. For each permutation of recipe pairs, the similarity of each recipe’s set of “favoriters” was calculated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Recipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;each&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x_recipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Recipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;each&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y_recipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;similarity_matrix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x_recipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y_recipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;jaccard_coefficient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x_recipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y_recipe&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# cardinality of intersection / cardinality of union&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;jaccard_coefficient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;favoriters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;favoriters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;favoriters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;favoriters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the matrix was built, recommendations for a given recipe could be generated by looking up the recipes which had the highest similarity in the given recipe’s row.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;generate_recommendations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;recipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;number_of_recommendations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;similarity_matrix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;recipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;max_by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;number_of_recommendations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;   
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;adding-some-context&quot;&gt;Adding some context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collaborative filtering alone wasn’t enough. With user favorites as the only
metric for determining recipe similarity, I found that the recommendations I was
generating weren’t very helpful. For example, when viewing the Chocolate Crinkle
Cookies recipe, you might see a recommendation for Chicken Noodle Soup because
many of the same users just happened to have favorited both recipes. The
recommendation engine was really just showing content that was popular, and to a
user, it would just look like we were displaying random recipes on the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add some context to the recommendations, I applied the Jaccard Index
technique to data from our recipe tagging system.  Recipes were scored for
tag similarity across 3 different categories: Dish Type, Main Ingredients, and
Recipe Type. I then combined the similarity scores from these 3 new datasets
with the user favorites similarity data using a 6 point system:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Similarity Set Metric&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Examples&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Points Possible&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Favoriters&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Users 1, 5, 7, 9&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Dish Type&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Salads, Breakfast, Breads&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Main Ingredient&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Chocolate, Beef, Vegetables&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Recipe Type&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Vegetarian, Quick and Easy, Grilling and Barbecue&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By bringing in those new datasets, the recommendation engine was able to make
suggestions of recipes that were both relevant and popular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/recommendations.png&quot; alt=&quot;Final product&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>All about that Buildpack</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;While upgrading our legacy production Wordpress blog app “The Feed” from Heroku stack Cedar-10 to Cedar-14, I had the opportunity to work with Heroku buildpacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-a-buildpack&quot;&gt;What’s a buildpack?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buildpacks are a tool for modifying how a Heroku app is built &amp;amp; deployed. For Heroku to support many languages &amp;amp; tools it tries to be an agnostic platform with no native support for any one language. Buildpacks can be managed as an independent GitHub repo. They behave like an adapter for customizing an app’s build process - in so far that a language can even be completely contained inside a buildpack if needed. In my scenario I used buildpacks to add operating system level dependencies that were missing from a new Ubuntu OS of the underlying Heroku app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-in-a-buildpack&quot;&gt;What’s in a buildpack?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a minimum in the root folder of the buildpack repo, a buildpack contains a bin directory with three Bash scripts: detect, compile, release:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;bin/detect&lt;/em&gt; - used to check if a specific file exists in order to continue or else will exit.
–Example, from Apache+PHP buildpack for Wordpress &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Americastestkitchen/heroku-wordpress-php&quot;&gt;https://github.com/Americastestkitchen/heroku-wordpress-php&lt;/a&gt;: here we check for the existence of an index.php file &amp;amp; output a happy or sad message visible during the Heroku build, for example:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#!/usr/bin/env bash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;if [ -f $1/index.php ]; then&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;echo &quot;index.php ATK heroku-wordpress-php&quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; exit 0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;else&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;echo &quot;index.php not detected&quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; exit 1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fi&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;bin/compile&lt;/em&gt; - the bulk of the work that modifies the heroku slug (more about slugs here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/slug-compiler&quot;&gt;https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/slug-compiler&lt;/a&gt;. For example: compile specifies where binaries are installed, Heroku config files are written, dependencies are resolved &amp;amp; installed, &amp;amp; static files are built.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;bin/release&lt;/em&gt; - modifies the heroku release (more about releases here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/releases&quot;&gt;https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/releases&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-challenge&quot;&gt;The Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created these additional buildpacks to assist the existing heroku-wordpress-php buildpack &amp;amp; the new heroku-buildpack-apt buildpack because Heroku’s Cedar-14 stack was missing some OS level dependencies, specifically libjpeg62 &amp;amp; libssl0.9.8. Heroku confirmed my issue in their documentation that certain Ubuntu packages were now missing from the new Cedar-14 stack (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cedar-ubuntu-packages&quot;&gt;Ubuntu Packages on Cedar and Cedar-14&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my scenario, the existing state of the app included two GitHub repos:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Feed - our private Wordpress blog repo&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apache+PHP buildpack for Wordpress &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Americastestkitchen/heroku-wordpress-php&quot;&gt;https://github.com/Americastestkitchen/heroku-wordpress-php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And by the end, the app included these additional repos:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ATK heroku-buildpack-apt &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Americastestkitchen/heroku-buildpack-apt&quot;&gt;https://github.com/Americastestkitchen/heroku-buildpack-apt&lt;/a&gt; -forked from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-apt&quot;&gt;ddollar/heroku-buildpack-apt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ATK heroku-buildpack-multi &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Americastestkitchen/heroku-buildpack-multi&quot;&gt;https://github.com/Americastestkitchen/heroku-buildpack-multi&lt;/a&gt; -forked from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-multi&quot;&gt;heroku/heroku-buildpack-multi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-solution&quot;&gt;The Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my solution I set &lt;em&gt;heroku-buildpack-multi&lt;/em&gt; as the primary buildpack of The Feed repo, then &lt;em&gt;heroku-buildpack-multi&lt;/em&gt; loads the two other buildpacks in the order specified in the .buildpacks file of The Feed repo.&lt;br /&gt;
.buildpacks file: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;heroku-buildpack-apt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;heroku-wordpress-php&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;heroku-buildpack-apt&lt;/em&gt; - This buildpack installs the missing Ubuntu system dependencies when Heroku is building the app. These dependencies are specified on separate lines in the &lt;em&gt;Aptfile&lt;/em&gt; file of The Feed repo. &lt;br /&gt;
Aptfile: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;libjpeg62&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;libssl0.9.8&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;heroku-wordpress-php&lt;/em&gt; - This is the existing buildpack which installs a specific version of Apache &amp;amp; PHP for our specific version of Wordpress.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;keep-in-mind&quot;&gt;Keep in mind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;–Since making changes to a buildpack affects the Heroku build process itself, testing any changes require re-deploying the app to Heroku. Use a non production test app for developing and testing your theories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–You can set an app’s primary buildpack in the CLI vs Heroku UI. Setting the buildpack in the Heroku app’s Settings in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dashboard.heroku.com&quot;&gt;Heroku Dashboard&lt;/a&gt; (under Reveal Config Vars) will set the buildpack as the default. However if a buildpack is set in the CLI it will take precedence over the one in the Heroku Dashboard but unfortunately will NOT visually change it in the Heroku Dashboard. Therefore I set the primary buildpack to heroku-buildpack-multi in both the Heroku Settings UI &amp;amp; the CLI to ensure consistency and avoid any confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;helpful-cli-commands&quot;&gt;Helpful CLI commands&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–Clear the buildpacks&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;heroku buildpacks:clear -a your-app-name&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–Set a buildpack&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;heroku buildpacks:set https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-multi.git -a your-app-name&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–Display a full list of options for the buildpacks command&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;heroku help buildpacks&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–Double check which buildpacks are set via the CLI with the heroku buildpacks command&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;heroku buildpacks -a your-app-name&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–List an app’s Heroku release history - useful if you need to roll back to a previous release&lt;br /&gt;
‘heroku releases -a your-app-name’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-uses&quot;&gt;Other uses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another possible use of buildpacks I stumbled upon was to include command utilities for troubleshooting which are not included automatically in the Heroku build. So for example if you wanted to troubleshoot an app’s network activity, you could have a buildpack install &lt;em&gt;traceroute&lt;/em&gt; during the build process so it can be used in the app’s Heroku bash console.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Getting It Done In A Flash</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently while working on a new project I stumbled across a neat little trick. The gist of the project was to create a landing page for our marketing group that they could use to direct customers to from a number of paid advertising programs. The landing page just included a form where we would collect some customer information and once it was submitted we would bring them to our homepage. Simple enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then came the tricky part. Because we were using paid advertising programs to direct customers to the landing page we needed a layer of metrics to determine if the campaigns were performing and how many customer we were converting. All of the advertising programs had their own set of tracking pixels and methods. Normally this would be easy because you could just include what ever code the tracking pixel required on a confirmation page. But this project didn’t have a confirmation page. The next page after submitting the form took the customer straight to our homepage. It didn’t make sense to include the tracking pixel code on our homepage. It seemed very inefficient to load these pixels every time the homepage loaded. Plus if a customer did come through the landing page, got to the homepage and starting using the site and natural hit the homepage several times the tracking pixels would fire and cause the conversion metrics to be inflated and inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I thought maybe I can do something using JavaScript to trigger the pixels at the appropriate time, but I wasn’t really thrilled to have to go down that path. Then I thought maybe I could use a cookie and trigger the pixels when the cookie was present, but I didn’t really love that idea either. I kept thinking to myself there must be an easy solution. If only Ruby on Rails had some way to trigger these pixels on the first load of the homepage when the referrer was the landing page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kept thinking about flash messages. I thought the mechanics of a flash message did exactly what I wanted but displaying a flash message wasn’t going to solve my problem. I decided to spend a little more time developing this idea. So I hit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#the-flash&quot;&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt;. The guide included the following bit: “The flash is a special part of the session which is cleared with each request. This means that values stored there will only be available in the next request, which is useful for passing error messages etc.” I thought perfect this is it! The “etc” part struck me. Could this be the key? The next line in the guide stated: “It is accessed in much the same way as the session, as a hash (it’s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/Flash/FlashHash.html&quot;&gt;FlashHash&lt;/a&gt; instance).” Then it clicked. This will work. I can use this just like I would a cookie but I wouldn’t have worry about the cookie persisting. This was a one and done solution. I could set the flash and use it to render a partial that included the code for the tracking pixels on the homepage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of the controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;400: Invalid request
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/eb3c7006d1b733d3b140.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of the view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;400: Invalid request
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/f5b2a280fadcffbf4810.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This little trick has opened my eyes to the power of the flash. I’m definitely going to be looking for more ways to use it on future projects.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Go for a Beginner</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;First - definition of a beginner for the purpose of this post – I started my time as a professional programmer almost 2 years ago. I was self taught mainly in python - followed by a term in a really great code bootcamp. I mainly develop in ruby on rails - with some backbone and react.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-go&quot;&gt;What is Go?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official answer is that Go, also called golang, is a programming language developed at Google in 2007 and is a statically typed language with garbage collection, type safety, some dynamic typing capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also according to https://golang.org/:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… it’s worth trying again with a new language, a concurrent, garbage-collected language with fast compilation…&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is possible to compile a large Go program in a few seconds on a single computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go provides a model for software construction that makes dependency analysis easy and avoids much of the overhead of C-style include files and libraries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go's type system has no hierarchy, so no time is spent defining the relationships between types. Also, although Go has static types the language attempts to make types feel lighter weight than in typical OO languages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go is fully garbage-collected and provides fundamental support for concurrent execution and communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By its design, Go proposes an approach for the construction of system software on multicore machines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-learn-go&quot;&gt;Why learn Go?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the syntax is easy to pick up - it feels simple and is easy to learn.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;really nice documentation help with the above point - https://golang.org/doc/faq is a nice place to start.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It has garbage collection - this is great for someone like me who is used to this being handled for me -  In many compiled languages one has to manage on your own, such as in native C++ which by default has no such thing - you an always write your own or use a third party solution, but Go does it for me!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;go compiles very quickly - speed is king.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I learned programming with dynamic typing. I had expected Go, being statically typed, to be more work painful to learn - especially after wrestling with tutorials for other languages . This was a great experience with static typing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ruby’s support for concurrency is something you need to set up with the help of a framework - like &lt;a href=&quot;http://celluloid.io/&quot;&gt;“Celluloid”&lt;/a&gt;. In Go - Go channels provide a concurrency primitive comparable to the actors model, and channels come baked in already.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other great things about Go - but I am focusing on my short list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-start&quot;&gt;How to start?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a tour of go - this is a really great place to start. ( https://tour.golang.org )&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a great place to look for tools - ( https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For web development  - after trying a few different configurations of libraries - I found gin to be best for me. ( https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin ), it is well docuamented and cuts down on a lot of boiler plate code. That said a great thing about the Go ecosystem is there are several different options.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>You Gotta Check Out This Enumerator, It'll Change Your Life I Swear!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, not really but it has made my job easier and I think it could do the same for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m relatively new to Ruby and in my past life my bread and butter language was PHP. When I was told that our stacks were going to be ripped down and replaced with Ruby on Rails I had mixed emotions. In one hand I was really excited to be working with Ruby on Rails. A new cool language to sink my teeth into. On the other hand I was going to be working with Ruby on Rails! I thought, OK maybe this wont be so bad. I can use what I know about PHP and apply it to Ruby on Rails.  So I hit the books and tutorials and anything I could get my hands on. I quickly learned that Ruby on Rails and Ruby had a lot of built in magic and PHP had none of that. It took me a long time to get my head around it. A colleague told me to just “believe in the magic”. Well, now I believe and I would like to share some of that “magic” with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the events that really help me believe was a suggestion from another colleague. He told me about this blog called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubytapas.com/&quot;&gt;“Ruby Tapas”&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://devblog.avdi.org/&quot;&gt;Avdi Grimm&lt;/a&gt;. You have to check it out! I can’t say enough good things about it but maybe I’ll save that for another blog post. Everyday I would go through his posts while commuting to work. I would sit on the train with my headphones on staring at my phone and continually saying out loud “ah that’s cool!”. My fellow commuters started to sit a little further away from me each day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of those “ah that’s cool!” moments came after I saw Avdi’s post about this strange enumerator called partition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-partition-and-what-does-it-do&quot;&gt;What is partition and what does it do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;http://apidock.com/ruby/Enumerable/partition&quot;&gt;apidock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“partition() public&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returns two arrays, the first containing the elements of enum for which the block evaluates to true, the second containing the rest.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In simpler terms it splits a collection into two subsets based on some criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days later after stumbling on this gem I was tasked with building a tool for our Web Edit Team. This team will sometimes free up content on our sites and they needed a quick and easy way to find out which pieces of content are currently free. The bit of logic we have built into our code to determine if a piece of content is free doesn’t use a status attribute but instead uses start and end dates to determine if something is currently free. I thought this would be so much easier if we just had a status attribute and I could easily just query everything that had a status of active. I thought, I could make a schema change and add the new attribute and run a daily job to check and alter the status but that just seemed like crazy town. Then I thought about the Ruby “magic” and the post I saw a few days earlier about partition. Everything just fell into place. I didn’t need to make a crazy schema change it was just for a view after all. Partition was exactly what I needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I built a helper that would take an array of hashes and easily split the array into to two arrays. An active array and an inactive array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;400: Invalid request
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/b4c06cc1e60351658bc9.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next part was even easier. I just needed to create a view that called the helper and returned the instance variables @active and @inactive. Once I checked for the presence of the instance variables all that was left to do was iterate over the arrays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;400: Invalid request
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/9c5cba7691834b525bef.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the next time you find yourself needing to split a collection into two subsets based on some criteria just remember this story and the “magic” of partition.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Value of Feedback: A Tale of Building An Internal Tool</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As most of us software engineers have known, tooling is a very important part of
our day. In fact, there was an
&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@leeb/why-invest-in-tools-3240ce289930&quot;&gt;eloquent post&lt;/a&gt; on
this subject matter recently. We are not the only discipline that benefit from
such tools. Below is a tale wrought with insight on how an iterative feedback
cycle influenced a tool we created for our WebEdit team to increase their
productivity while creating unstructured content.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;problem-scoping&quot;&gt;Problem Scoping&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;: At America’s Test Kitchen, we are working on a new content type
(internally called an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Article&lt;/code&gt;) that is more complicated than our current
content offerings. Instead of having highly structured data, we are designing
this to be free flowing (think &lt;em&gt;one wysiwyg to rule them all&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stack&lt;/em&gt;: Our stack for this piece of content is a Ruby on Rails back-end with a
shiny new React front-end utilizing both &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/flux/&quot;&gt;flux&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rackt/react-router&quot;&gt;react-router&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Problem&lt;/em&gt;: Our WebEdit team, the people that create all of our wonderful web 
content, need sophisticated previewing tools for this unstructured offering.
And that is what we are building, a semi-realtime previewing engine that gives
content creators &lt;em&gt;instantaneous&lt;/em&gt; feedback for their free flowing content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;slight-tangent-about-why-article-content-is-a-big-deal&quot;&gt;Slight Tangent About Why Article Content Is A Big Deal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is purely from a technical standpoint.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To date, the majority of our content is denormalized and very rigid in
structure. We have given our WebEdit team a CMS that mostly involves inputting 
text and creating necessary associations between our content (there are very 
minimal text fields that allow for custom HTML). This general work flow gives us
consistency on our front-end for our users but really doesn’t allow WebEdit to
create custom content from a layout perspective. Look at the two pdfs 
below as examples of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Article&lt;/code&gt; content:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/pdfs/Article_Brownies.pdf&quot;&gt;Chewy Brownies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/pdfs/Article_BakedAlaska.pdf&quot;&gt;Baked Alaska&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying that these pages are much, &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more engaging than our
current crop of documents. That is not meant to be a knock on  our current
documents. It’s just a different means of conveying to our users
what went right and what went &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; in the kitchen as we develop recipes. We
do not have a content vehicle to effectively communicate what
went wrong in the kitchen because failures differ wildly from recipe to recipe.
What fails for a brownie may be absolutely different than what can fail for
flank steak. Conveying this &lt;em&gt;failure&lt;/em&gt; message effectively is the goal of our 
upcoming Article content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;minimum-viable-product&quot;&gt;Minimum Viable Product&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our prototype is going to be a proof of concept. Technologies used:
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;JSXTransformer&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;iframe&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jQuery&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;React&lt;/code&gt;. In our current CMS (created with
bootstrap), we are going to have a preview button that brings said &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;iframe&lt;/code&gt; into
view with the click of a button. As someone changes the one html field, it will
re-render the iframe and reload the entire page with the new data (similar
to CodePen.io).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/1OhoJW5GqFM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holy smokes Batman! Well, we are off to a great start. You can see that as we 
type, we have a request firing off to reload the page with the new value. The
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ArticlePreviewContainer&lt;/code&gt; then transpiles the JSX and evaluates it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original thinking behind this was to make it similar to CodePen using some
&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/ncerminara/11257943&quot;&gt;Base64 shenanigans gist&lt;/a&gt; and created
both a Rails route and React route both looking like: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/admin/article/:id/:base&lt;/code&gt;.
Using the gist above, we are encoding the value of the body input into &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Base64&lt;/code&gt;
and passing it to the routes for the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:base&lt;/code&gt; parameter.  We even having it 
working with one of our custom React components! Hot Sauce! Here is what our 
React Preview Component looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;400: Invalid request
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/92afacec15a159292256.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might ask yourself, “What’s up with that RecipeIndexPage require at the top?”
Currently, it is the only custom component I am allowing to be rendered in the
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ArticlePreviewContainer&lt;/code&gt; React component. Requiring it was the only way I
thought to show WebEdit what it looks like when using custom components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of WebEdit, it’s time to meet with them to get their thoughts on this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mvp---feedback-cycle&quot;&gt;MVP - Feedback Cycle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Just going to put my scribbled down notes from WebEdit below…)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is really cool, but does it have to be inside the same window? Can we 
put it in it’s own window?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can we get some sort of error message if we write bad markup (JSX)?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can we get documentation for the various components we have access too?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Some notes I took down when dogfooding it to the engineering team…)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Iframe? Wat? Why aren’t you using postMessage?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We should definitely whitelist things that they have access too using 
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;React.Children.map&lt;/code&gt; for this content.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;JSXTransformer&lt;/code&gt; is being deprecated. Use Babel and pass over the transpiledJS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoa. All great, great ideas. Definitely going to incorporate this feedback into
my MVP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;version-2---the-previewwindow-and-postmessageand-linting&quot;&gt;Version 2 - The previewWindow and postMessage…and linting?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here is where the fun begins!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technologies used:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/src/babel/api/browser.js&quot;&gt;Babel browser.js&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eslint/eslint&quot;&gt;eslint&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://underscorejs.org/&quot;&gt;Underscore&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage&quot;&gt;postMessage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technologies being removed: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;iframe&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;JSXTransformer&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Base64 gist&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only real code to care about here is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;400: Invalid request
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/fe02ffe6f8a39a3668ef.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We register a keyup event on the singular input field with a delay using 
Underscore’s debounce method. When the callback is invoked, it performs the
following functions:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Lints the JSX.&lt;br /&gt;
2a) On failure, disable all submit buttons and display an error message.&lt;br /&gt;
2b On success, enable all submit buttons and transform the JSX using 
babel (and wrap it in an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Article&lt;/code&gt; react component for…reasons).&lt;br /&gt;
3) After transformation, it checks for our previewWindow and posts the message
to the previewWindow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YO7VZx0zjw0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time for one more round of feedback!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;version-2---feedback-cycle&quot;&gt;Version 2 - Feedback Cycle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Going back to my scribbled down notes from WebEdit…)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is much better. But when I update the title, it doesn’t update!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We still need a style guide to let us know what the markup looks like and
what it outputs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Going back to my scribbled down notes from engineering…)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Where is my white list!!?!?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Where is the friggin white list??&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Moar white list please!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright…thanks guys. I can feel the feature already maturing as I received no
feedback on the actual implementation of it and mostly received feedback on 
evolving it and protecting WebEdit where I can (white listing). We are definitely
on the right track, so let’s start moving onto version 3!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;version-3---final-final-release-maybe&quot;&gt;Version 3 - Final Final Release (Maybe?)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead of listening to a single input (on ‘keyup’), we need to bind our 
postMessage event to more inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the code for said event passing JSON and listening to &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;400: Invalid request
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/d35e6fcda00b68301c74.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White listing didn’t prove very difficult either. We created a mixin that would
traverse the component’s children and return null if it was 
not in the list (hence why we wrapped the resultant JSX in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Article&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags).
Currently, it only supports white listing of HTML elements that React supports.
We will be modifying the conditional logic to also check for a white list of 
custom components in the very near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whitelist&quot;&gt;Whitelist:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;400: Invalid request
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/e501bdd75b8971f84975.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;article-component-white-listing&quot;&gt;Article Component White Listing:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;400: Invalid request
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/b8e91ccdb26d7e6b7337.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s this look like now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/3mkwPOC_uYo&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the WebEdit’s need for documented components, we found an
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jmfurlott/react-styleguide&quot;&gt;open sourced project&lt;/a&gt; that has
been amazing for conveying both markup and the actual look of the component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a doubt the feedback cycle from both the end user of this tool (WebEdit)
and from other engineers vastly improved the quality and maintainability of the
tool. Going from MVP to something much more robust and maintainable can only be
realized by getting feedback early and often as features are worked on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, WebEdit can now be highly productive in using this near
real-time tool to build really amazing content.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Little Style for Our Stylesheets</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve written previously on this blog about &lt;a href=&quot;http://americastestkitchen.github.io/css/2014/10/05/css-debates/&quot;&gt;CSS best practices&lt;/a&gt;, and in the eight months since that post, our team has continued to churn out new CSS like there’s no tomorrow. At the beginning of this year, we embarked on a massive redesign of one of our sites, and that meant new color schemes, new typography, and, probably most notably, responsive layouts. Given that this also meant we would be able to write brand new stylesheets for essentially brand new pages, and that we would (eventually) be able to scrap most of our old styles, this redesign seemed like the perfect opportunity to set some standards for our CSS going forward in the form of a CSS style guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, developing a first draft of the style guide was the easy part. There are lots of great examples out there (I give credit to &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@fat/mediums-css-is-actually-pretty-fucking-good-b8e2a6c78b06&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; for being my personal inspiration for this whole endeavor), and after writing CSS for a certain amount of time, a lot of the pain points become clear, so it didn’t take long for us to come up with a list of rules that we wanted to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a little more context, the redesigned pages were built using React, and we are essentially maintaining a React app within our Rails app in order to segregate these new pages from our legacy views. Since all of our new React code and the associated styles were housed in their own &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/react&lt;/code&gt; directory, we were able to use the structure of our React components to drive the organization of our new stylesheets, without having to worry about reorganizing our legacy stylesheets. With the new pages being fully responsive, we got to use some pretty nice gems (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;susy&lt;/code&gt; for our grid layout, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;breakpoint&lt;/code&gt; for clean media queries), and we also were able to use our different breakpoints to inform stylesheet structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that, I give you our style guide (a working draft, I’ll call it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;file-structure&quot;&gt;File Structure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;main.scss&lt;/code&gt; imports all of our partials and mixins, which are organized into logical blocks with comments.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Folders:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Feature folder with subfolders for breakpoints (e.g. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;search/desktop&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;search/mobile&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;search/tablet&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Mixins folder (includes any polyfills)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Layouts folder (e.g. for a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_grid.scss&lt;/code&gt; file)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Vendors folder (e.g. for a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_normalize.scss&lt;/code&gt; file)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;scss-implementable-rules&quot;&gt;SCSS Implementable Rules&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;naming&quot;&gt;Naming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prepend ids and classes being bound by JavaScript with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;js-&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prepend ids and classes being bound by React with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;react-&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prepend state-based css classes with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;is-&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prepend newly created mixins with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;m-&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use BEM (block, element, modifier) naming conventions for classes whenever possible.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;E.g.: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gallery__image--large&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;selectors&quot;&gt;Selectors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To avoid issues with specificity, never use an id as the selector for styling an element.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;We have made a few exceptions to this rule in order to prevent styles for new features from conflicting with legacy styles, with the intention of removing references to ids in stylesheets once legacy styles are sunsetted.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the minimum number of selectors you need to target an element for styling.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To avoid adding complexity, try to avoid nesting selectors when possible.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A good exception to this rule would be the use of pseudo selectors in the vein of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nth-child&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nth-of-type&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;variables&quot;&gt;Variables&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make use of our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;z-index&lt;/code&gt; scale file (which borrows heavily from &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@fat/mediums-css-is-actually-pretty-fucking-good-b8e2a6c78b06&quot;&gt;Medium’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;z-index&lt;/code&gt; scale&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s what it looks like:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;400: Invalid request
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/be26dedc217a3e08f8c1.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use our own line-height, font-weight, and letter-spacing scale files.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Color variables and font variables should be declared in separate files and referenced whenever possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;general-style&quot;&gt;General Style&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Comma separated selectors should each be declared on a new line.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Include exactly one line break after each selector block.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use single quotes for URLs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the font shorthand when possible (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;font: 14px $proximanova $black&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@include&lt;/code&gt;s (for breakpoints) should be declared at the top of a given breakpoint-specific stylesheet, and should wrap all breakpoint-specific styles.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Always use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rgb&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rgba&lt;/code&gt; for colors, to avoid mixing hex codes and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rgba&lt;/code&gt; for instances where transparency is needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;grid&quot;&gt;Grid&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Elements should always be on the established grid (the assumption being that the design team will always place elements in the context of a grid going forward).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Horizontal padding and margins should be of some factor of our established gutter widths.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;breakpoints&quot;&gt;Breakpoints&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Place breakpoint declarations inside a new file and folder &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BREAKPOINT_NAME/component_name&lt;/code&gt;, per the file structure above (e.g. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tablet/_load_more_button.scss&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As much as possible, avoid duplication of shared styles across different breakpoints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lessons-learned&quot;&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hard part, maybe not surprisingly, has been actually implementing the rules we prescribed above. So in addition to sharing our style guide, I also wanted to share a few things I learned in implementing it, which will hopefully help anyone out there who is thinking about implementing a CSS style guide of their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;be-vigilant&quot;&gt;Be vigilant&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve learned the hard way the importance of getting CSS code into as good a state as possible before calling a feature “done”. We’ve all said to ourselves “I’m just going to get this to look right, and then I’ll come back and refactor later.” &lt;em&gt;Except that you won’t. Because &lt;strong&gt;refactoring CSS is terrible&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Class names tend to be quite “sticky” and resistent to refactoring given the way they get reused, and after giving in to a suboptimal solution in order to fix a bug quickly, changing things can feel precarious. This is why it’s worth spending a little extra time up front to make sure you are following your own rules (harder to do than I thought). The same goes for reviewing code from other team members – it’s worth being a little nitpicky on the initial pull request for the sake of everyone’s future sanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;make-peace-with-your-legacy-styles&quot;&gt;Make peace with your legacy styles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite my idealistic visions of creating perfect, beautiful CSS without the weighty baggage of our legacy styles dragging us down, the reality of the situation was a little different. Even though we were building new pages, we were going to be slowly rolling them out to users, while still maintaining many of the existing pages (and thus stylesheets) for quite some time. Our CSS could still be beautiful, but we needed a strategy to combat legacy style conflicts. Our approach for this has evolved over time, from commenting any lines of code that were written to handle legacy style issues, to temporarily scoping new styles under top-level id selectors (and hating ourselves for it), to creating a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;resets&lt;/code&gt; directory to house only styles that were needed to reconcile conflicts between old and new styles. None of these strategies have been ideal, but the main point here is that, even when I thought we had found the perfect time to implement a CSS style guide, with minimal refactoring of legacy code required, it still had (and continues to have) its challenges. So if you’re waiting for that perfect time to implement your own style guide, the good news is you don’t have to wait anymore! Right now is probably as good a time as any to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;keep-iterating&quot;&gt;Keep iterating&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My final takeaway from this process is the importance of regularly reevaluating the utility of a style guide’s rules. After all, such a guide is meant to make our lives as programmers easier, in addition to improving our code quality. As we started using our guide, we thought of things we needed to add (a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vendors&lt;/code&gt; directory), exceptions we needed to make (when nesting is okay) and rules we needed to clarify (why are we using this font scale thing again?). Even as I write this, I’m thinking I should ask the team again if they have more ideas for updates. So as much as rules are made to be followed (that’s the saying, right?), since they are going to be internal rules for our team, I think there is always room to revisit and iterate. And in the process, I think we’ve made our stylesheets more readable, more logical, and quite a bit more bearable to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>One Big Advantage to Remote Employment</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve worked almost my entire adult life from home: first as a translator, then
as a programmer. In fact, in the twelve years since finishing college, I’ve
only worked in a office for eighteen months, eleven of which were in Russia, so
I’m not sure that even counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My remote work history falls into three buckets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Self-employment.&lt;/em&gt; You’d better like solitude for this (I do), because it
involves basically &lt;em&gt;no human contact at all&lt;/em&gt; during working hours. I’m not
sure I’d recommend this to others.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;All-remote teams.&lt;/em&gt; This is my favorite arrangement. You get the same level
of quiet most of the time and still have your Get Out Of Shower Free card to
play, but you have other humans (or maybe chatbots that pass the Turing Test –
I haven’t always managed to verify) to bounce ideas off, assist with debugging,
etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mixed remote/on-site teams.&lt;/em&gt; This is perhaps the most common arrangment I’ve
encountered, and it’s what we have at ATK, but it brings with it a particular
set of challenges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past year and a half, we’ve grown from a team of four to a team of
eleven, and though others occasionally work from home when needed, only two of
us live far enough outside of the Boston area that we consistently work
remotely. The shift in our remote:on-site ratio has produced a few wrinkles,
but I am generally still a very happy remote worker because of all the
advantages and flexibility that remote work confers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m feeling particularly good about one aspect of this today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/office.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Office.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-am-actually-writing-this-in-a-tent&quot;&gt;I AM ACTUALLY WRITING THIS IN A TENT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is correct. The photo above is my “Thursday/Friday office.” I have to
admit that I actually structured this post so that the picture would be below
the fold for dramatic effect. I thought about titling this “Tent-Driven
Development,” but that could have given it away. But seriously, working in the
woods is amazing, and I really suggest you try it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-work-in-a-tent&quot;&gt;How to work in a tent&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four principle components to an office campsite:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Land&lt;/em&gt;. In my case, we are converting a piece of property into a farm, so I
get this for free. But campgrounds are everywhere, and are often very
inexpensive.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sustenance&lt;/em&gt;. Bring water – lots of water – and a cooler full of snacks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Power&lt;/em&gt;. If you are at the right campground, this is no big deal. In my
case, I have a GoalZero 150Wh battery with a small solar charger. On sunny
days, I can get 2 full charges into my 15” MBP, 1.5 if it’s cloudy. This
doesn’t leave a lot of room for running iTunes all day, or for forgetting to
bring your laptop fully charged.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Internet&lt;/em&gt;. I ended up getting a Verizon hotspot, which works extremely
well. It is, in fact, substantially faster than my Charter broadband at home.
At $50/month for 5GB of transfer, it’s not exactly cheap, but it turns out that
is not such a bad thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;improved-office-productivity-through-outdoorsmanship&quot;&gt;Improved office productivity through outdoorsmanship&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have found that my coding hours in a tent produce a lot more working,
well-reasoned code than those during the rest of the week under fluorescent
lights. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first reason for this is bandwidth restriction. If I exceed my 4GB
limit, I get hit another $15 for every gigabyte of overage. This incentivizes
me not to click on the cat pictures or even conference presentations that
bounce around in our Slack rooms. StackOverflow pages take up very few bytes on
the wire compared to YouTube streams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more important aspect, however, is being visibly and audibly surrounded by a
variety of living things. If you have never found your job at least a little
dehumanizing – you know, staring into a glowing rectangle and smashing buttons
to send signals to a robot – I’m fairly suspicious that you’ve already been
assimilated by the Borg. Sometimes I see a deer, or a fox, when I’m up getting
a drink; sometimes I can look up and see our resident redtail hawk circling
over the clearing. We know that &lt;a href=&quot;http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/27/easing-brain-fatigue-with-a-walk-in-the-park/?_r=0&quot;&gt;spending time with trees reduces
stress&lt;/a&gt;,
and we know that programming can be stressful. It is great to be able to get
that relief immediately by looking around you, rather than waiting for the end
of the work day to go to the park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;taking-it-up-a-notch-the-kickstarter-campaign&quot;&gt;Taking it up a notch: the Kickstarter campaign&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just kidding. That would be ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Value of Postmortems</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s 2am and your phone wakes you. Servers down. Sleepily, you muster the energy
to get out of bed and start troubleshooting system issues and resolve them after
two hours. You are able to go back to sleep for that extra beauty rest
before going into work. Of course the moment you are in the office, everyone
wants to know of your heroic deeds, from the steps needed to resolve the issue
to the actual issue at hand. You painstakingly recount the root issue and the
attempt to discuss the exact steps taken to solve it. Everyone is intently
listening to your story when all of a sudden, you forget the order of operations
needed to resolve the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether or not you forget the replication steps to solve the issue, this 
rather familiar scenario is where a postmortem can help your team. A postmortem
would immediately disseminate the necessary information (asynchronously)
reducing the need for this somewhat awkward group discussion. In addition,
the engineer should be receiving &lt;a href=&quot;http://media.giphy.com/media/Cp9cUJc4hgNvG/giphy.gif&quot;&gt;the highest of fives&lt;/a&gt;
for getting the business back online &lt;em&gt;AND&lt;/em&gt; appropriately documenting every
step of the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;shifting-to-a-blameless-culture&quot;&gt;Shifting to a Blameless Culture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When considering postmortems for your company, one has to be mindful of
maintaing a culture of being completely &lt;a href=&quot;https://codeascraft.com/2012/05/22/blameless-postmortems/&quot;&gt;blameless&lt;/a&gt;.
This &lt;em&gt;has to exist&lt;/em&gt; for postmortems to have any value to an organization.
The main point of postmortems is to disseminate information and educate team 
members on specific issues that bring down systems. We want to break up those
important system wide knowledge silos in as positive a fashion as we can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say Greg had been working rather late one evening to ship a feature. He had
accidentally left out the all important &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; in our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;clock.rb&lt;/code&gt; file, causing all
of our scheduled jobs to fail. This failure actually went undetected for an
extra day or two as our error provider never picked up any errors (our clock
process would not boot up).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More often than not, Greg will more than likely already feel terrible for being
the root contributor to the issue at hand. Adding a layer of blame to that is
just not needed or warranted and may have negative effects on his professional
development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the sake of our postmortem, it also does not matter one bit that Greg was at 
fault for this issue. What matters is that the symptoms of the issue are 
correctly documented, the solution is well documented, and there are regression
tests for this scenario (when applicable).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tools-we-use&quot;&gt;Tools We Use&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We really enjoy using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/discourse/discourse&quot;&gt;discourse&lt;/a&gt; for
documenting everything that relates to our development processes, including
our postmortems. Not only does it enable a team of 
developers to document all the things using the tools we know and love
(i.e. Markdown), but the threaded forum format &lt;em&gt;encourages continued discussion&lt;/em&gt; 
of the issues involved. The search quality is pretty good, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;overcoming-hurdles&quot;&gt;Overcoming Hurdles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4am isn’t the easiest time to write eloquent prose. As engineers, we need to be in 
the habit of taking notes and snapshots as we go (repeatable trace of commands,
analysis of logs, etc), being mindful of the need to compile a postmortem afterwards.
Writing a postmortem well after the events have
transpired with little documentation can lead to incorrect diagnosis and
misremembering the various analyses performed to determine the root cause of the
issue.  It’s paramount that the postmortem be written no later than 48 hours after the
downtime. Analysis and command history get lost quickly, especially in the heat
of the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any organization that is technical in nature should implement some form of 
documentation about downtime and critical issues. The thoughtful curation and 
creation of these long lived documents will help any organization in the long
term through knowledge dissemination.&lt;/p&gt;
